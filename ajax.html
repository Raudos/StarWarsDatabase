			<p>X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive S-foils that resembled an 'X' in attack formation. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used T-65B X-wing starfighters in a number of battles, including the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.
			<br><br>
			The X-Wing was originally developed for the Galactic Empire but the entire Incom design team defected with the prototypes to the Rebel Alliance, ending the contract. Despite this, however, at least one X-wing was stolen by a Stormtrooper.
			Approximately thirty years later, a different variation of X-wing, the T-70 were used by the Resistance, whereas a more advanced model, the T-85, was used by the New Republic Starfleet.

			<p>The Y-wing starfighter was a two-seat starfighter used during the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War.<br><br>

			Y-wings used during the Clone Wars were crewed by a single pilot, and a gunner inside an ion cannon turret positioned behind the cockpit. Located behind the turret was an astromech droid slot. The 23.4-meter long attack starfighter had two forward-mounted laser cannons, along with two proton torpedo launchers. The wedge-shaped cockpit was placed on the front of the craft, with the central spar extending behind it. Two ion jet engines were attached to either side of the spar. The engines had exhaust nacelles and support pylons, and had domes that contained sensors on the front of the nacelles.<br><br>

			<p>The RZ-1 A-wing starfighter was a high-speed starfighter manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering. Influenced by the designs of the Republic starfighters flown during the Clone Wars, the A-wing was wedge-shaped with dual engines mounted on the stern. The craft came equipped with a hyperdrive. The fighters were armed with two laser cannons and concussion missiles. The A-wings measured 9.6 meters long.<br><br>

			A-wings were often modified. The most common variant seen in the Alliance favored raw speed, consisting of a stock model stripped of its shields, armor and heavy weapons. As a result, the ship was faster than the Empire's variant, the TIE Interceptor.<br><br>

			The B-wing, though difficult to fly, participated in numerous engagements across the galaxy during the latter parts of the Galactic Civil War, including the Battle of Endor and the liberation of Coruscant. <br><br>

			<p>Mon Calamari Star Cruisers were the main cruisers in the Rebel Alliance/New Republic fleet for a significant portion of the Galactic Civil War.<br><br>

			The hallmark of the design was typically very strong shielding with a respectable battery of turbolasers and ion cannons. They did not have as much total firepower as an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. However, the Mon Calamari cruiser made up with this with a better all-around firing arc, compared to the Star Destroyer which could project firepower effectively to the front and sides but not the rear. They also had highly accurate targeting computers, giving them an advantage in long-range battles.<br><br>

			Rebellion-era Mon Calamari ships had extremely powerful deflector shields for ships of their size, in part because their civilian-spec hull structure was somewhat weaker than a true military starship. A distinguishing feature of Mon Calamari cruisers was the redundancy of weaker shield generators contributing to the shielding system. Mon Calamari cruisers carried three times the usual number of generators for ships of their size.

			<p>The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate was a 300-meter-long warship that was built by Kuat Drive Yards for use by the Imperial Navy, to protect convoys from Rebel Alliance starfighter actions. It was, however, used more famously by the Rebellion. <br><br>
			The standard Nebulon-B frigate was armed with twelve turbolasers, twelve laser cannons, and two tractor beam projectors. It was designed to carry twenty-four TIE Series starfighters.
			While generally well-armed for a vessel of that size, its midsection connecting spar was a vulnerability. It could be split open by concentrated heavy weapons fire, venting the frigate's atmosphere and killing most of the crew<br><br>
			The EF76 was used extensively by both sides in the Galactic Civil War. The frigate was known and respected for its efficiency against fighters and bombers, and its anti-fighter assignment in Imperial convoys had an immediate impact, causing the Rebels to reconsider their hyperspace raids after suffering irreplaceable losses in fighters and pilots.<br>

It possessed the same legendary adaptability as other CEC products, which allowed it to serve in roles as mundane as freight hauling or as a high-profile diplomatic escort. <br><br>
			Common configurations included a troop carrier, light escort vessel, cargo transport, or passenger liner. Its ease of modification was a trademark of CEC and increased the corvette's resale value.[1] One of the rarer variants could carry starfighters, such as the Night Caller and Constrictor. <br>

Many of these transports served the Alliance Fleet during the Galactic Civil War, including playing a pivotal role in the evacuation of the Rebellion's Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth. <br><br>

			A sister design to the civilian GR-45 model, the GR-75 was used by freight drivers and shipping firms to haul cargo. The transport's outer hull was like a thick shell with the interior entirely open for cargo pods. This open-space design could fit up to 19,000 metric tons of cargo into the 90 meter long ship. Modular cargo pods greatly sped up the loading and unloading process. <br><br>

			When the transport was at its cargo capacity, a magnetic shield locked the modules in place, while at the same time kept out the vacuum of space. The factory model included space for forty passengers, but almost all ships traded it for increased cargo storage. <br>

Designs for the TIE fighter were partly based on the Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor.<br><br>

			TIE/LN starfighter were small in size and manufactured in masses by the Empire. They were outfitted with an ejection seat and twin laser cannons mounted to the "chin" section of the cockpit module.[7] Seemingly a disposable vessel, Wilhuff Tarkin dreaded the thought of ever having to pilot one due to its cramped cockpit. <br><br>

			Due to their distinctive dual-hull shape, TIE bombers came to be referred to occasionally as "dupes" or (albeit indirectly) "sitting ducks" by enemy pilots. The latter nickname was due to its bulky structure making it much slower and far less maneuverable than other TIE craft. <br><br>

Designed and built by Huppla Pasa Tisc Shipwrights Collective, the starfighter's frame was, like many other types of Geonosian starship, made from thin strands of pliable laminasteel, a long metallic substance that was also used in constructing Geonosian hives. <br>

			<p>The Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I, also known as the Vulture-class starfighter or more simply as the vulture droid, was a model of droid starfighter utilized by the Trade Federation and later the Confederacy of Independent Systems. <br><br>

			Vulture droids were capable of maneuvers that would crush even the sturdiest organic pilot, but lacked the resourcefulness and cunning that living pilots brought into combat.<br><br>

			Like the ground forces made up of battle droids, vulture droids were controlled by a control ship, but as time passed, they were able to operate with limited independence. They were also known to be able to communicate with each other by chattering. While not in flight, vulture droids could transform into walking mode to patrol the surface or provide support during battles.<br><br>

			The design of the vulture droid formed the basis for producing the hyena-class bomber, another type of automated droid starfighter used by the Separatist Alliance.<br><br>

			It was a successor-design to the LH-3010 capital freighter. Originally used as commerce vessels, these vessels were manufactured exclusively for the Trade Federation, and became part of its large merchant fleet. <br><br>

			During the lead-up to the Naboo crisis, the Federation modified approximately ten to thirty-five percent of its operational freighters for use as armed battleships. Some were converted into army-coordinating Droid Control Ships. Vessels blockading Naboo were disguised as regular trade ships to avoid skepticism in the Galactic Senate. LH-3210s were later modified and amassed into the Confederate Navy during the Clone Wars. <br>

			The supply ship was over one thousand meters wide and housed several hangar bays, which could accommodate multiple C-9979 landing craft to transport the battle droid infantry of the Separatist Droid Army to battlefields across the galaxy. Being able to store over five million metric tons of cargo, it was primarily used for arms and resupply shipments to the organic defense armies in the Confederacy military, often supporting planetary campaigns from orbit. It was armed with point-defense laser cannons and could be crewed by B1 battle droids overseen by a T-series tactical droid.

			<p>The Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter, also known as the ARC-170 starfighter and Advanced Recon fighter, was a heavy starfighter that saw widespread use by the Republic Navy throughout the Clone Wars. Designed and manufactured by the Incom Corporation, the ARC-170 was an ancestor of the T-65 X-wing starfighter, which would be mainly used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic.<br><br>

			The ARC-170 was jointly produced by Incom and Subpro Corporation. Like their other starfighter designs of its time, such as the lighter Z-95, and the heavier PTB-625, and NTB-630, the ARC-170 had a narrow spaceframe flanked by large engines. The ARC-170 also possessed an S-foil system, which helped to radiate heat, something that aided the fighter's shielding. This also provided additional stability during atmospheric flight.
			The ARC-170 was a departure from other starfighter designs of the Clone Wars era. Fighters such as the Alpha-3 Nimbus and the Eta-2 Actis were built to be small, fast, and maneuverable, at the cost of heavy weapons, shields, and hyperdrives. On the other hand, the ARC-170 was large, rugged, and capable of long independent operations. <br>

			The V-19 was unique in that it had two pairs of folding airfoils (S-foils) that gave the ship added maneuverability and provided pilots with easy access to the cockpit's sliding canopy. The lower, hinged S-foils coupled with enhanced repulsorlift engines made the V-19 an exceptional vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter. <br><br>

			Its armament consisted of two laser cannons (one on each wingtip) and two concussion missile launchers. The number of concussion missiles carried by the V-19 was at least six. At Muunilinst, it was shown that these missiles were capable of independently acquiring and tracking their own targets. Anakin Skywalker took advantage of this feature to destroy a swarm of Nantex-class starfighters and a gun platform. <br>

Countless variants of the Headhunter were produced, including a variant designed specifically to be piloted by the Grand Army of the Republic's pilots during the Clone Wars. It was the forerunner of the popular T-65B X-wing starfighter. <br>

			Even after the end of the Clone Wars, Z-95 Headhunters were, according to Wilhuff Tarkin, common enough to "have come from anywhere." Several were used by Berch Teller's rebel cell in their fight against the Galactic Empire.<br>

			They were used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Although slightly slower and less maneuverable than its successor, this craft was armed with center-mounted ion cannon that is capable of penetrating shields and giving damage to targets under its cover.

It was a variant design of the earlier Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, with the Delta-7B featuring a relocated astromech droid slot and a slightly enlarged hull.<br>

			The Delta-7B was manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering, and initially saw use as Delta-7's were lost in battle. The main difference between the Delta-7B and its predecessor the Delta-7, was a relocation of the astromech socket from the port (left) side of the starfighter, to just in front of the cockpit. This, along with a slightly-enlarged center-hull, would allow for a full-size astromech droid to be used instead of the truncated units-- such as the R4-P or the R3-D -- seen in the earlier-model Delta-7. Also like the Delta-7, the Delta-7B had 4 twin laser-cannons (2 above the "triangular"-shaped hull, and 2 right below the "upper" cannons, on the underside of the hull). It also typically depended on other spacecraft or an external hyperdrive ring for faster-than-light travel. <br>

It was designed and constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and Allanteen Six shipyards.<br><br>

			While designed primarily for ship-to-ship combat, the Venator had secondary roles ranging from starfighter carrier, to military transport and battleship escort. The expanded carrier role made the Venator-class popular amongst Jedi starfighter aces.<br><br>

			As a popular multi-role warship of the Republic Navy, the Venator was considered heavily armed and armored enough to lead assaults on Rim worlds like Utapau as well as fast enough to chase down blockade runners. Due to being relatively less self-sufficient than other ships in the fleet, the Venator-class often relied upon supply lines to aid long-range campaigns.<br>

Two identical emplacements were located on the ventral bow, while four dual-barreled turbolaser batteries were located on the sides of the cruiser. Large slits on either side of these cannons allowed them to be repositioned for frontal, broadside or backwards firing. This function, combined with the dorsal & ventral turrets, granted the ship a good arc of fire.<br><br>

			All gun emplacements were retracted into the hull during re-entry to prevent the barrels from being damaged by sudden drag force. The bridge/bow turrets descended/ascended into large trap-door hatches, while the flank cannons receded into the bow prongs.<br>

			The 752-meter-long Acclamator-class assault transport carried thousands of Republic clone troopers into battle. The Acclamator favored a wedge or dagger shaped design due to its effectiveness—it allowed concentration of firepower while minimizing target profile. This basic design was used in a number of larger craft predating it and would define Imperial ships for decades to come. These ships were armed with 4 heavy torpedo launch tubes; 24 point-defense laser cannons, rated at 6 megatons per shot; and 12 quad turbolaser turrets, each rated at a maximum of 200 gigatons per shot. <br>
