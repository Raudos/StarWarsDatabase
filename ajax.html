			<p>X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive S-foils that resembled an 'X' in attack formation. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used T-65B X-wing starfighters in a number of battles, including the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.
			<br><br>
			Approximately thirty years later, a different variation of X-wing, the T-70 were used by the Resistance, whereas a more advanced model, the T-85, was used by the New Republic Starfleet.

			<p>The Y-wing starfighter was a two-seat starfighter used during the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War.<br><br>

			Y-wings used during the Clone Wars were crewed by a single pilot, and a gunner inside an ion cannon turret positioned behind the cockpit. Located behind the turret was an astromech droid slot. The 23.4-meter long attack starfighter had two forward-mounted laser cannons, along with two proton torpedo launchers. The wedge-shaped cockpit was placed on the front of the craft, with the central spar extending behind it. Two ion jet engines were attached to either side of the spar. The engines had exhaust nacelles and support pylons, and had domes that contained sensors on the front of the nacelles.The hyperdrive was at the rear of the spar. Squadron markings were placed on the cockpit and the forward tips of the engine nacelles.<br><br>

			<p>The RZ-1 A-wing starfighter was a high-speed starfighter manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering. Influenced by the designs of the Republic starfighters flown during the Clone Wars, the A-wing was wedge-shaped with dual engines mounted on the stern. The craft came equipped with a hyperdrive. The fighters were armed with two laser cannons and concussion missiles. The A-wings measured 9.6 meters long.<br><br>

			A-wings were often modified. The most common variant seen in the Alliance favored raw speed, consisting of a stock model stripped of its shields, armor and heavy weapons. As a result, the ship was faster than the Empire's variant, the TIE Interceptor.<br><br>

			<p>The A/SF-01 B-wing heavy assault starfighter, known simply as the B-wing starfighter, was one of the largest and most heavily armed starfighters/bombers in the Rebel Alliance's fleet. The name B-wing came from the craft's appearance to a "B", when upright, the outline of the upper half and the lower half makes a B shape, although its swordlike shape in attack mode has earned it the nickname "Blade-wing", which may be another reason for the "B" prefix.<br><br>

			Known as "crosses" due to their distinct shape, the B-wing was designed by the Verpine company Slayn & Korpil in cooperation with then-Commander Gial Ackbar as part of the Shantipole Project. The B-wing, though difficult to fly, participated in numerous engagements across the galaxy during the latter parts of the Galactic Civil War, including the Battle of Endor and the liberation of Coruscant. The B-wing was used in its primary role of assault starfighter by both the New Republic and the Galactic Alliance throughout the Yuuzhan Vong War and beyond.<br><br>

			<p>Mon Calamari Star Cruisers were the main cruisers in the Rebel Alliance/New Republic fleet for a significant portion of the Galactic Civil War.<br><br>

			The hallmark of the design was typically very strong shielding with a respectable battery of turbolasers and ion cannons. They did not have as much total firepower as an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. However, the Mon Calamari cruiser made up with this with a better all-around firing arc, compared to the Star Destroyer which could project firepower effectively to the front and sides but not the rear. They also had highly accurate targeting computers, giving them an advantage in long-range battles.<br><br>

			Rebellion-era Mon Calamari ships had extremely powerful deflector shields for ships of their size, in part because their civilian-spec hull structure was somewhat weaker than a true military starship. A distinguishing feature of Mon Calamari cruisers was the redundancy of weaker shield generators contributing to the shielding system. Mon Calamari cruisers carried three times the usual number of generators for ships of their size. Although each generator was weaker than the Imperial standard unit, the quantity of shield generators allowed for faster energy replenishment. Also, this made the generators much harder to destroy, as they could not be seen clearly and were in fact inside the ship.These shields also allowed Mon Calamari Cruisers to survive better against spacial elemental threats.

			<p>The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate was a 300-meter-long warship that was built by Kuat Drive Yards for use by the Imperial Navy, to protect convoys from Rebel Alliance starfighter actions. It was, however, used more famously by the Rebellion. <br><br>
			The standard Nebulon-B frigate was armed with twelve turbolasers, twelve laser cannons, and two tractor beam projectors. It was designed to carry twenty-four TIE Series starfighters.
			While generally well-armed for a vessel of that size, its midsection connecting spar was a vulnerability. It could be split open by concentrated heavy weapons fire, venting the frigate's atmosphere and killing most of the crew<br><br>
			The EF76 was used extensively by both sides in the Galactic Civil War. The frigate was known and respected for its efficiency against fighters and bombers, and its anti-fighter assignment in Imperial convoys had an immediate impact, causing the Rebels to reconsider their hyperspace raids after suffering irreplaceable losses in fighters and pilots.<br>

			<p>The CR90 corvette, commonly referred to as the Corellian corvette or the Rebel blockade runner, also known as an Alderaan cruiser, was a small, multi-purpose capital ship manufactured by Corellian Engineering Corporation.<br><br>

			The CR90 had a wide variety of users throughout the galaxy, from pirates to corporations to galactic navies, and had a known operational life from at least as early as 52 BBY to as late as 137 ABY. It possessed the same legendary adaptability as other CEC products, which allowed it to serve in roles as mundane as freight hauling or as a high-profile diplomatic escort. <br><br>
			Common configurations included a troop carrier, light escort vessel, cargo transport, or passenger liner. Its ease of modification was a trademark of CEC and increased the corvette's resale value.[1] One of the rarer variants could carry starfighters, such as the Night Caller and Constrictor. <br>

			<p>The GR-75 medium transport, also known as the Gallofree medium transport or Rebel transport, was a clamshell-hulled transport produced by Gallofree Yards, Inc. Many of these transports served the Alliance Fleet during the Galactic Civil War, including playing a pivotal role in the evacuation of the Rebellion's Echo Base during the Battle of Hoth. <br><br>

			A sister design to the civilian GR-45 model, the GR-75 was used by freight drivers and shipping firms to haul cargo. The transport's outer hull was like a thick shell with the interior entirely open for cargo pods. This open-space design could fit up to 19,000 metric tons of cargo into the 90 meter long ship. Modular cargo pods greatly sped up the loading and unloading process. <br><br>

			When the transport was at its cargo capacity, a magnetic shield locked the modules in place, while at the same time kept out the vacuum of space. The factory model included space for forty passengers, but almost all ships traded it for increased cargo storage. <br>
