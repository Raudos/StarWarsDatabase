			<p>X-wing starfighters were a type of starfighter marked by their distinctive S-foils that resembled an 'X' in attack formation. During the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance used T-65B X-wing starfighters in a number of battles, including the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.
			<br><br>
			Approximately thirty years later, a different variation of X-wing, the T-70 were used by the Resistance, whereas a more advanced model, the T-85, was used by the New Republic Starfleet.

			<p>The Y-wing starfighter was a two-seat starfighter used during the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War.<br><br>

			Y-wings used during the Clone Wars were crewed by a single pilot, and a gunner inside an ion cannon turret positioned behind the cockpit. Located behind the turret was an astromech droid slot. The 23.4-meter long attack starfighter had two forward-mounted laser cannons, along with two proton torpedo launchers. The wedge-shaped cockpit was placed on the front of the craft, with the central spar extending behind it. Two ion jet engines were attached to either side of the spar. The engines had exhaust nacelles and support pylons, and had domes that contained sensors on the front of the nacelles.The hyperdrive was at the rear of the spar. Squadron markings were placed on the cockpit and the forward tips of the engine nacelles.<br><br>

			<p>The RZ-1 A-wing starfighter was a high-speed starfighter manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering. Influenced by the designs of the Republic starfighters flown during the Clone Wars, the A-wing was wedge-shaped with dual engines mounted on the stern. The craft came equipped with a hyperdrive. The fighters were armed with two laser cannons and concussion missiles. The A-wings measured 9.6 meters long.<br><br>

			A-wings were often modified. The most common variant seen in the Alliance favored raw speed, consisting of a stock model stripped of its shields, armor and heavy weapons. As a result, the ship was faster than the Empire's variant, the TIE Interceptor.<br><br>

			<p>The A/SF-01 B-wing heavy assault starfighter, known simply as the B-wing starfighter, was one of the largest and most heavily armed starfighters/bombers in the Rebel Alliance's fleet. The name B-wing came from the craft's appearance to a "B", when upright, the outline of the upper half and the lower half makes a B shape, although its swordlike shape in attack mode has earned it the nickname "Blade-wing", which may be another reason for the "B" prefix.<br><br>

			Known as "crosses" due to their distinct shape, the B-wing was designed by the Verpine company Slayn & Korpil in cooperation with then-Commander Gial Ackbar as part of the Shantipole Project. The B-wing, though difficult to fly, participated in numerous engagements across the galaxy during the latter parts of the Galactic Civil War, including the Battle of Endor and the liberation of Coruscant. The B-wing was used in its primary role of assault starfighter by both the New Republic and the Galactic Alliance throughout the Yuuzhan Vong War and beyond.<br><br>
